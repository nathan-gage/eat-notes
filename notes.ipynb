    "### Tame vs. Wil\n",
    "The text contrasts \"tame\" spaces with \"wild\" ones. An example of a wild space is given by the graph of the function sin(1/x) for 0 < x < 1. This space is problematic because it doesn't behave nicely when trying to extend it to a closed interval. Tame spaces, on the other hand, avoid such complexities and are easier to work with.\n",

    "These are mathematical frameworks that allow for the definition of tame spaces. They are based on a set of axioms that define how sets and functions behave in a tame manner. The axioms ensure that the sets are closed under certain operations like taking Cartesian products, projections, and finite unions.\n",

    "### Definable Sets and Mappings\n",
    "In this context, a set or function is called \"definable\" if it fits within the framework of an o-minimal structure. Definable sets can be understood in terms of tame geometry, and definable functions are those whose graphs are tame.\n",

    "This theorem states that any definable set can be transformed into a collection of simple geometric shapes called simplices (like triangles in 2D, tetrahedra in 3D, etc.), which are open and disjoint. The boundaries of these simplices relate to each other in a tame way.\n",

    "This is the idea that definable homeomorphisms (one-to-one, onto, and continuous functions with continuous inverses) can be thought of like cutting and rearranging paper without changing its basic properties. This concept is useful for understanding how spaces can be manipulated in tame topology.\n",
